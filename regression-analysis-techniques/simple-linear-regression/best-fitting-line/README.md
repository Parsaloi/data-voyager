## Computing the **least-squares-prediction-line**

## TL;DR

This `python3` application:

* `generate_random_data` : generates random data in the 0-100 range

* `calculate_least_squares` : finds the estimates used to plot the prediction line

* `plot_best_fitting_line` : plots the corresponding prediction-line saved in a `png` file


To run it requires:
* `python3.8` or higher
* `python-poetry` for dependency management

```bash
# install application dependencies
poetry install

# run it!
poetry run best-fitting-line
```


> _Linux users may find a linux package for `poetry`  from their favourite Linux distribution_

> _MacOS users can use `brew install poetry`

> _Windows users can install an extension for poetry on their favourite IDEs such as vscode_
